# giocoCarte
This project was carried out by Francesco Malferrari (me) and Lorenzo Ferrarini in 2019.
It represents a card game commissioned by the CNR (Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche) on climate change during the second quarter of the last year of ITIS Fermi high school in Modena.
"GiocoCarte" was also our paper during the final exam.
For information on game mechanics, the software components needed to start it and more, you can read the "GiocoClima.pdf" file.
Despite the presence of a bug, for being the first major software project I tackled I am proud of the result.
